<h2>Welcome</h2>

Hello! I am a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist,</strong> dedicated to solving complex problems and making a meaningful impact on people's lives. I thrive on understanding and implementing machine learning models from scratch, diving deep into the code. Check my <a href="/cv/"> Resume/CV</a>, and my <a href="/portfolio/">Portfolio</a>.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working across a wide range of domains, including:
- <strong>VideoQA:</strong> Exploring video-language interactions for question answering.
- <strong>Multimodal AI:</strong> Building pose estimation models using depth, infrared, and RGB data.
- <strong>Healthcare AI:</strong> ECG classification on PhysioNet datasets.
- <strong>Robotics:</strong> Designing solutions for left-wall following and obstacle avoidance using Fuzzy Logic.
- <strong>Time Series Forecasting:</strong> Predicting energy surpluses for Colchester and Brighton City.
- <strong>NFT Prediction:</strong> Developing models for price movement prediction.
- <strong>Text Analysis:</strong> Text classification, generation, and sentiment analysis of the Pakistani public regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
- <strong>Image Analysis:</strong> Tackling challenges like image classification, segmentation, and COVID-19 CT scan analysis.

I’m driven by a vision to push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence and apply it to real-world challenges that improve lives.
