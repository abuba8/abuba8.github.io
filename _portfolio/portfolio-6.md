<p>Proposed a hybrid architecture with residual and inception blocks for classifying ECG abnormalities into 27 classes using the PhysioNet Kaggle dataset. Incorporated additional features such as age and sex, processing multi-frequency ECG signals ranging from 257 Hz to 1 kHz. Achieved the third-best Kaggle competition score of 50.87%, demonstrating effective classification of heart disease patterns in diverse datasets.
