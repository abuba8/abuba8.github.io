Developed a system integrating computer vision and decision-making components, leveraging technologies such as pre-trained YOLOv5 for object detection to ensure real-time obstacle avoidance and hazard detection. Led the collection and preprocessing of video data from multiple sources, including real-time footage captured via Zed mini cameras, and processed this data for training deep learning models. Contributed to deployment of LLMs and optimized models to run efficiently on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Achieved significant accuracy in object detection and sound localization tasks, surpassing 85%.
