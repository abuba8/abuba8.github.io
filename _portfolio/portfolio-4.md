Worked with a team of three ML Engineers for in-bed pose estimation using multiple modalities including depth, long-wavelength infrared, and RGB. Collected multi-modal data of 70+ participants and 13,000 pose images (using Azure Kinect) in three different room settings to ensure robustness. Integrated domain cameras APIs for data collection; and developed Tkinter-based annotation tool for cross-domain joints labeling of the collected dataset. Implemented Stacked Hourglass network using depth and LWIR modalities to predict joint heatmaps. Achieved a high performance of 71\% at PCKh@0.5.
